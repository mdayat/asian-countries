## What
**Do'ain** is an app that shows a list of do'a in Islam, especially daily do'a. You can search specific do'a through the search feature, the do'a that will be displayed by the search feature is the first do'a that the application finds according to the search keyword.

## Tech Stack
It's a pain in the ass to set up this project from scratch. It should be an easy thing to set up a Node.js project frankly, but it becomes hard because the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ecosystem is not yet fully supported for ESM. So, here is the tech stack I used in this project:

**Core Tech Stack**:
1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Helper Tools**:
1. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
2. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html)
