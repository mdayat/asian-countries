## What
This is an app that shows a list of Asian countries. You can search for a specific country by its name. Additionally, you can filter countries based on the Asia subregion.

## Tech Stack
It's a pain in the ass to set up this project from scratch. It should be an easy thing to set up a Node.js project frankly, but it becomes hard because the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ecosystem is not yet fully supported for ESM. So, here is the tech stack I used in this project:

**Core Tech Stack**:
1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Helper Tools**:
1. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
2. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html)
