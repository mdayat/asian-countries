## What
The description of this file is pretty much the same as the description in the main branch. This branch, however, is intended for submission only, which is required to use "JavaScript".

## Tech Stack
It's a pain in the ass to set up this project from scratch. It should be an easy thing to set up a Node.js project frankly, but it becomes hard because the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ecosystem is not yet fully supported for ESM. So, here is the tech stack I used in this project:

**Core Tech Stack**:
1. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Helper Tools**:
1. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
2. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html)
