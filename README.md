## Tech Stack
It's a pain in the ass to set up this project from scratch. It should be easy to set up a Node.js project frankly, but it is hard because the [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) ecosystem is not yet fully supported for ESM. So, here is the tech stack I used in this project:

**Core Tech Stack**:
1. [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
2. [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)

**Helper Tools**:
1. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
2. [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/getting-started.html)
